# Wetness-Variability-in-Zvecevo
The aim of this exercise was to determine whether grassland wetness in the Zvečevo area has changed over the past ten years using satellite-based remote sensing. To assess temporal variation in surface moisture spectral indices were calculated:  STR, NDPI, NDWI and NDMI, in addition with satellite-based inundation model developed by Jussila et al.
